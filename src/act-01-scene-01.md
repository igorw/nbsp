# Act I

## The Io Moonad

*MrSpacerGif, nbsp and SpaceKitten are in space. they have re-appropriated one of the moons of jupiter as a spaceship, by attaching some pretty sweet engines that are thrusting the sphere further away from the sun.*

MrSpacerGif: I'm feeling cold. I'm hungry. But I don't want to get up. Can somebody make me some hot chololate? Please? I feel so empty today.

nbsp: What am I, your slave? Make your own goddamn hot chocolate. As a matter of fact, I'm going to make myself some hot chocolate, and you aren't getting *any at all*. You want some hot chocolate, space kitten?

SpaceKitten: Meow.

nbsp: It's been two years since we left the geo cities. I could not give less fucks. But ever since the cyberspace warp drive broke down last week it's been cold on our moon. Well, what is a self-taught cosmonautista to do? Sometimes you just have to deal with it. Even if it means putting up with MrSpacerJif, who, for some reason is not wanting to get out of bed this morning.

MrSpacerGif: Fine. I'm getting up.

nbsp: Good. As I was saying, we left behind civilisation, in order to persue our dream: an epic search for happiness. It must be out there somewhere. We have learned not to fly too close to the sun, so we are going in the opposite direction. So much is yet to be discovered.

SpaceKitten: Meow.

MrSpacerGif: Sometimes I feel invisible. It's almost as if people do not acknowledge my existence. Yet without me, the whole universe would collapse. I am filling the void. I am holding everything together. I am MrSpacerGif! I'm kind of a big deal.

nbsp: Yeah, whatever. SpacerJif, can you open a jifsocket to our miner drones? I just noticed that we're out of nibblecoins again.

MrSpacerGif: Sure, gif me a second.

*MrSpacerGif walks over to the couch, grabs his phone and presses some seemlingly random buttons.*

MrSpacerGif: The nibblecoin miner drones are reporting 5 new hash collisions found. Forwarding them to the mainframe now.

nbsp: You see, the moon named Io, that we are now using as a space travel device, contains a self-sufficient cryptographic synthesis system!

MrSpacerGif: We're not quite sure how it works yet, but it runs on a currency that we have called nibblecoin. By finding hash collisions in the rainbow chain, you can feed the Io Moonad. Or rather, pay it to feed you.

nbsp: Indeed, when you provide the system with hash collisions, it produces organic material. There must be some sort of synthesis going on. Am I right, space kitten?

SpaceKitten: Meow.

nbsp: You're a good girl. Okay, configuring the mainframe for hot chocolate, transmitting the hashes. Okay, here we go.

*nbsp pulls some switch, mainframe beeps and flashes blinken lights.*

nbsp: It took ages to get the recipe for hot chocolate right. You need to input the recipe in form of genetic code, encoded as a whitespace program. It's quite an involved procedure. Especially debugging those infinite loops can be quite the pain.

SpaceKitten: Meow.

*Synthesis port that is attached to moon mountain opens, two hot chocolate cups comes out.*

nbsp: Woot, I managed to synthesize our names on to the cups. Brute-forcing the algorithm for that took much longer than those few hash collisions. But I guess you have a lot of time in space.

*Hands hot chocolate to MrSpacerGif, they both take a sip.*
